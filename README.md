## Current Situation ;	
	There exists already two AI models in place in EuroControl that do similar tasks:
An AI model to predict the typical turnaround time
An AI model to predict the typical taxi-out time

	There’s also already an EuroControl project in progress to develop an AI model to predict whether or not the deicing process will be necessary for a given plane.This project, however, has no intention to predict how long the deicing process will take.

	Whilst analysis of how ice forms on aircrafts is commonplace in academic papers and in the industry [1], attempts to predict the time a deicing process will take have not been found on publicly available sources nor scientific papers by anybody on the team.

## Expected Results

 The main objective of the project, as stated before, is the development of a model to predict the additional time an aircraft will spend in the airport due to the deicing period. There are, however, things surrounding such a model that also need to be created so it can be useful. Thus, it’s expected that, at the end of the project, the following list of deliverables be adequately completed:

An AI model to predict the deicing time of a plane
An API to access such a model
A visual way to show the previously mentioned AI model working
	
A document on how to use all of these programs, what their inputs and outputs are, will also be needed.
